# Churnalist
This repository contains the code for Churnalist, a headline generator. Churnalist is meant as a creative writing support tool for game writers. 

## Installation
Install all requirements in a virtual environment:
```
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Datasets for seedword extrapolation
Churnalist uses ConceptNet and FastText to expand the list of seedwords if the input text is short. The ConceptNet API requires a working internet connection and is relatively fast. FastText requires the large (15+ Gb) FastText language models but work completely offline. Since the suggestions of ConceptNet are better than FastText's and FastText models take a long time to load, Churnalist uses FastText as a fall-back method if ConceptNet doesn't work.

If you want to use the FastText word embeddings, you need the FastText language model. Note that this model requires at least 17 Gb of free space on your hard drive! It's not essential for Churnalist to function
Download and extract the [FastText Wiki word vectors](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/pretrained-vectors.html) for English and place them in data/fasttext.
```
$ wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/vectors-wiki/wiki.en.zip
$ unzip -d data/fasttext wiki.en.zip
```
